    This file has had three shapes and this contract has had three jobs.

    v6 wrote every string three times — a Persian field default, an English
    overlay applied by `apply()`, and a Persian restore — and the contract's job
    was to check the three key sets still matched. v1 collapsed that to a single
    immutable English table and the job became "no second table may come back".
    Persian is back now, and the shape that avoids BOTH failure modes is a
    computed getter: `val X: String get() = if (farsi) "…" else "…"`.

    So the thing to defend is the shape itself. One line per string means a
    missing translation is a compile error rather than a silently English label,

    the old direction while every string it re-read was in the new language: a
    half-translated screen with the drawer hinged on the wrong side and the menu
    glyph unflipped, recoverable only by force-quitting.

    No private key, and no credential, anywhere in the repository.

    This tree used to ship its own release key on purpose, with the store password

    `.gitignore` to force it past the rule that was supposed to stop exactly that.
    The reasoning was that losing the key forces every user to uninstall and
    reinstall, so keeping it with the source made it hard to lose.

    That trade is defensible while a build is being handed to one person and
    indefensible the moment the tree becomes a public repository: anyone holding the
    key can publish an update that users' phones accept as genuine, and a leaked
    signing key cannot be revoked — it can only be replaced, which costs every user
    their API key, settings and chats.
