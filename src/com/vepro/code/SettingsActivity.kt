/**
 * Settings — a power user's control surface, not a preferences list.
 *
 * ### One silhouette
 *
 * Every group on this screen is the same object: a grey [Ui.sectionLabel]
 * introduces it, and the group itself is a flat [Ui.groupedCard] on the page
 * ground. There used to be TWO silhouettes — six filled cards and three bare
 * hairline tracks (protocol, theme, language) — so a third of the column read as
 * a different design from the rest. The segmented tracks now live INSIDE a card
 * like everything else, on a [Theme.SURFACE] ground so they are still visible
 * against the card's own [Theme.SURFACE_2].
 *
 * ### Separation inside a card
 *
 * A dense card is no longer one undifferentiated slab: rows are parted by an
 * INSET [Ui.divider] hairline that starts where the labels start, so the glyph
 * column reads as a continuous rail down the card and each row still reads as
 * its own line. [Ui.divider]'s own doc warns this is usually the wrong answer —
 * it is the right one here, because a settings card is a LIST, and a list of
 * eight identically-shaped rows with nothing between them is a wall.
 *
 * ### Explanations belong to their group
 *
 * A group's long explanation is the last block INSIDE its card, under a
 * hairline, rather than a paragraph floating on the page below it. Floating
 * footnotes made the vertical rhythm lumpy — a card, a gap, some prose, a
 * bigger gap, a heading — and left prose with no visible owner.
 *
 * ### One kind of meter
 *
 * The temperature dial and the reasoning dial are built from the same three
 * pieces ([blockHead], [styleSeek], [meterCaptions]), so they cannot drift into
 * two different-looking sliders again. Both carry a mono readout on the trailing
 * edge and two [Ui.Type.MICRO] captions naming the ends of the range.
 *
 * ### Appearance is one group
 *
 * Theme and language sit in ONE card under one heading, because both answer
 * "how does the app look" and neither changes what the agent does. They are the
 * same segmented track, each named by a [blockCaption] and parted by a hairline,
 * with a single closing note covering the pair. Two adjacent cards holding one
 * track apiece would have been two silhouettes again for no gain.
 *
 * ### Persian mirrors, and these are the seams
 *
 * The root sets `layoutDirection = Lang.direction(this)` and the whole tree
 * flips, because every inset here is `setPaddingRelative` / `marginStart` /
 * `Gravity.START`. What that does NOT reach is anything positioned in PHYSICAL
 * pixels or anything whose meaning is Latin, so those are named individually:
 *
 *  * **Directional glyphs** come from [Lang.chevronBack] / [Lang.chevronForward]
 *    — the masthead's back arrow and every "opens something" chevron point at
 *    the edge they mean rather than at a fixed side.
 *  * **LTR islands** — the API key, the router keys, the base URL, the model
 *    name, the number fields and the connection row's `host · model · protocol`
 *    line — pin themselves to `LAYOUT_DIRECTION_LTR` / `TEXT_DIRECTION_LTR` and
 *    then pin their ALIGNMENT back to the view's start edge, so a Latin
 *    identifier still reads left-to-right while sitting on the reading edge of a
 *    mirrored row.
 *  * **The two meters** mirror with the interface (see [styleSeek]): a magnitude
 *    is laid along the reading axis, and in Persian that axis runs from the
 *    right.
 *  * **Numbers** are shown in the interface's own numerals via [Lang.num] and
 *    [localizeDigits]; numbers the user TYPES are normalised back to ASCII by
 *    [normalizeDigits].
 *  * **Tracking** ([blockCaption], the masthead title) is a Latin device and is
 *    zeroed in Persian, which is a joined script.
 *
 * ### Colour
 *
 * There is no accent colour here: every token is black, white or a grey between
 * them. The single exception is the connection row's state dot, which uses the
 * diff inks — the one sanctioned hue in the palette — because "reachable" and
 * "rejected" are opposites, not two amounts of one thing, and lightness alone
 * cannot say which is which.
 *
 * The Vega mark appears exactly ONCE in the whole app, in the About group at
 * the bottom of this screen. The chat screen shows no logo at all.
